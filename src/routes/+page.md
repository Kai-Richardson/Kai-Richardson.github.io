# Hello!

I'm Kai, a full-stack and FOSS game developer.

## Work

I work at [Trimble](https://trimble.com), helping the company connect and scale via robust integration offerings with external and internal services.

Primarily working on robust APIs and integrations w/ C# .NET, DevOps on Azure & GitHub, and front-end via React.

## Things I Do

- [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/) - One of the largest free and open-source videogames.

    - I'm a maintainer for the [Goonstation flavor of the game](https://github.com/goonstation/goonstation).
    - I also help maintain several other community tools, [like a external library](https://github.com/tgstation/rust-g) we use to offload heavy tasks, written in **Rust**.
    - I also help work on a [compiler/runtime/server/client](https://github.com/OpenDreamProject/OpenDream) for the game sometimes when I'm not busy with the above.

- GitHub Apps - I have developed multiple Apps, Actions, and Workflows on GitHub for the community. These are used by over 150 people worldwide.

- Cooking. Lots of it.

### Things I've Done

- I gave [a talk](https://2023.fossy.us/schedule/presentation/92/index.html) at [FOSSY 2023](https://2023.fossy.us) about open-source development methodologies!
- Many other tiny projects
